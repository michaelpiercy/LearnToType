# LearnToType - WIP

A Solar2D application built with Lua. A little something to help my kids learn their way around a keyboard.

Random letters appear on a chalkboard and the player has limited time to type the corresponding letter on the keyboard.

Two game play modes: Letters and Words.

Built for 1920 x 1080 dimensions.
